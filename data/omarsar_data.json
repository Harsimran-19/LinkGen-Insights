Previous works synthesize data using either instance-driven approaches (e.g., using seed corpus) or key-point-driven methods (e.g., using topic/subject). Both of these approaches lack the desired coverage, quality, and perspectives needed to robustly scale the data synthesis process.To measure the quality of the synthetic datasets, they performed an out-of-distribution evaluation on MATH. A fine-tuned model on their synthesized 1.07M math problems achieves 64.9% on MATH, matching the performance of gpt-4-turbo-preview at only a 7B scale.Their method is not only effective for MATH problems, but it can also be used to generate logical reasoning problems, instructions, game NPCs, tool development, knowledge-rich text, and many more use cases. https://lnkd.in/eYMpHMqs↓Follow my weekly summary of the top AI and LLM papers.

It's inspired by the ReAct framework and integrates a dual-component memory system. It utilizes a scratchpad and retrieved examples to augment the agent's capabilities. The scratchpad serves as a transient storage (akin to short-term memory) and the retrieval module operates as the agent's long-term memory. So you can think of this as a framework that combines ReAcT, a scratchpad, and a retrieval system.This system mirrors human short-term and long-term memory and helps to maintain context and continuity which are key in conversational systems.One benefit of such a system is the ability to customize and control the behavior of the conversational system. This work also shows the potential to fine-tune the LLM within the RAISE framework which leads to enhanced controllability. RAISE was tested on the real-estate domain and showed superior performance as compared to the conventional conversational agents. For every use case, there might be a need to control for different aspects of an LLM-powered agent. This can range from customizing the working memory components to changing the effectiveness of retrieval of certain types of information.I like the idea of modularity in a conversational agent but that means there are more variables to control.

LLMs are enabling key features like understanding user query intent, fetching knowledge, generating search queries, and summarizing results. All these components require deep expertise as you aim to build with complex solutions like data warehouses. With Data LLM (from Abacus.AI), it's possible to leverage the capabilities of LLMs to interact with data warehouses to support all kinds of use cases. For instance, product managers or marketers can instantly pull customer data reports such as “Number of signups by the day of the week in the US”, “No of customers who churned at a regional level”, etc.The Data LLM Agent is given access to your data warehouse and it extracts metadata about tables and stores it in a document retriever. Different embedding strategies are available to store the vectors in the document retriever.That is fairly easy to set up with the Abacus platform with security in mind. A user can now interact with the AI-powered Data LLM Agent which performs a few steps to carry out the user query. The user query is used to retrieve relevant tables and metadata. The agent leverages an LLM (e.g., Claude, GPT-4, or Llama 2) to form the SQL query that will be used to query the data warehouse. The data that's returned is then summarized using another LLM with the goal of answering the question asked by the user.You can deploy and engage with the Data LLM Agent through the provided dashboard or set up bots that communicate with other platforms like Teams and Slack. Abacus also provides API endpoints to power other apps or even enable agents to talk to each other. This is a powerful solution that enables companies to leverage their data in creative ways.

Uses instruction-tuning to improve zero-shot and few-shot generalization abilities.Here is my quick summary of the paper ↓It presents a large benchmark called OPT-IML for instruction meta-learning of 2K NLP tasks. The goal is to use the framework to find insights about instruction-tuning decisions applied to OPT-30B. The insights are then used to instruction-tune large versions of OPT (30B & 175B).The paper provides an interesting analysis of the effects of instruction-tuning and reports tradeoffs and best practices. Results are reported for different sampling strategies during tuning, scaling laws wrt to tasks & categories, fine-tuning with task demonstrations, and more.As an example of the experiments conducted, the authors report results of scaling the number of training tasks on each generalization level (fully held-out, partially supervised, and fully supervised) for the OPT-IML 30B model under both 0-shot and 5-shot settings. Results show that the most improvements are seen in the fully held-out & partially supervised tasks. Fully supervised tasks' performance remains mostly unchanged, which is desirable. The best settings observed in these experiments are used to effectively train large OPT models (30B & 175B).Overall, there is an entire section in the paper demonstrating that the instruction-tuned models can obtain significant improvements over untuned models on both zero- and few-shot settings on multiple benchmarks (e.g., PromptSource & FLAN) and different standard NLP tasks.Not all is perfect and there are limitations in this work. For example, results show that the large OPT-IML models are competitive on RAFT but lag behind other models like FLAN-PaLM and instruction-tuned GPT-3 models (*davinci) on MMLU and Big Bench Hard.Instruction-tuning continues to show promising results so we can expect to see more work in this area.
